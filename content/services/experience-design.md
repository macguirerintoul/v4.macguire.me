title: Experience Design
---

Every interaction yields an experience. The purpose of experience design is to tailor that experience; to make it a certain way. Most often, experience design is used to make things feel easy, enjoyable, and positive overall.

Right now, I'm doing this at [Visier](https://visier.com) as a User Experience Designer. My job is to make working with the Visier analytics platform easy.

In the past, I've done this at Vancouver Coastal Health, where [an app](/work/roar) I created is used to coordinate training sessions for new staff.

Feel free to [contact me](/contact) if you're interested in work like this.
