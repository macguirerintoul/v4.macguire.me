## Contribution

As the project manager, I ensured the various parts of the project were being completed according to our project timeline, and made sure they were cohesive. As the content strategist, I wrote copy based on our project's strategy and validated its effectiveness with the target audience. I also developed and promoted a qualitative and quantitative research survey that received over 450 responses, which heavily informed the project's direction.

## Problem

Despite having physical, environmental, and financial benefits, lack of exposure in mainstream media and markets has prevented widespread use of menstrual cups. The majority of menstruators already use tampons, pads, and/or liners, and are not convinced to undertake the physical and emotional risk of switching menstrual hygiene products. While the Lena Cup is recognized as the #1 cup for beginners, Lena's existing site does not effectively communicate the product's value and benefits to potential customers.

## Solution

The Switch by Lena directly addresses false assumptions, apprehensions, and concerns consumers may have about menstrual cups.

Our survey of over 450 respondents suggested that most customers were convinced to try a menstrual cup by a close friend or sibling. To create a meaningful experience, the team decided to strategize content from the perspective of a supportive, older sister. As the content strategist, I ensured that all content followed this principle and had a consistent tone and attitude.

## Process

After identifying business problems within the menstrual cup market, we identified frictions with Lena's existing website. Information was scattered across multiple pages, and neglected to highlight the product’s extensive benefits. We then conducted a survey to understand peoples' perception of cups and the factors influencing this perception, in order to design a digital experience that encouraged visitors to try the product.

After considering the various opportunities for this project as well as its scope and timeframe, we focused on addressing the apprehensions of potential customers.

/>

We then developed personas from common themes in our research: we chose to design for the 'Accustomed & Uncertain' menstruator, who uses other menstrual products and does not know enough about cups to switch over.

The nature of the product lends itself to a rocky customer journey. Our research suggests the struggle of switching is recognized by the majority of cup users, but is said to be well worth it. Considering the business problems, we chose to address the pre-purchase stages and aimed to convey the value of menstrual cups more effectively.

### Awareness

For the awareness stage, we considered how customers might find out about The Switch.

  content="The final step of the onboarding emphasizes Lena's customer satisfaction policy and reminds visitors that they can return their cup for a full refund."

### Consideration

Lena's current site has a stories section, but doesn't feature any content related to personal experiences with cups. We found this was a missed opportunity, seeing as based on the number of reviews and discussion online, cup users love to share their stories. Our research also suggested that if people could see how using a cup would impact their lifestyle, they would feel more comfortable with them.

### Ongoing use

As advertised on their site, Lena is happy to have representatives answer any questions their customers have, or give advice to those just starting out. To make sure customers feel taken care of, Lena can reach out and ask how things are going. When customers write positive reviews, Lena could ask them to share their story on the Lena website and continue the cycle.

## Reflection

Throughout the project, we may have been too ambitious about the issues we were trying to address. Trying to reduce gender dysphoria with a brand that was fairly feminine was difficult, and reducing the stigma around periods could have been an entire project on its own. The team learned a lot trying to address these issues, but deciding on one opportunity earlier in the project would have allowed more time for iteration and validation.
