## Highlights

- conducted thorough user research with a survey of over 450 respondents
- designed an end-to-end customer experience that made switching to a menstrual cup easier

## Contribution

As the project manager, I ensured the various parts of the project were being completed according to our project timeline, and made sure they were cohesive. As the content strategist, I wrote copy based on our project's strategy and validated its effectiveness with the target audience. I also developed and promoted a qualitative and quantitative research survey that received over 450 responses, which heavily informed the project's direction.

## Opportunity

Despite having physical, environmental, and financial benefits, lack of exposure in mainstream media and markets has prevented widespread use of menstrual cups. The majority of menstruators already use tampons, pads, and/or liners, and are not convinced to undertake the physical and emotional risk of switching menstrual hygiene products. While the Lena Cup is recognized as the #1 cup for beginners, Lena's existing site does not effectively communicate the product's value and benefits to potential customers.

## Outcome

The Switch by Lena directly addresses false assumptions, apprehensions, and concerns consumers may have about menstrual cups.
