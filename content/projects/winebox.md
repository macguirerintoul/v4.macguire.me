summary: "One of the most common problems casual wine collectors face is keeping track of their favourite wines and wineries. Since many collectors are only moderately interested, many aren't invested enough to spend time on organization, but later forget the details of wines they enjoyed. After observing these problems across several adult couples, we decided to design a digital solution during an interface design course at SFU."

## Highlights

- conducted user research with 18 participants
- designed features to address their needs

## Contribution

As one of the interface designers, I was responsible for designing the collection tab of Winebox, as well as features in other tabs. As the primary researcher, I developed a survey of 18 respondents, and conducted interviews and think-aloud user tests with various wine collectors to inform and validate the project. At the end of the course, I revised the visual design of the interface.

## Opportunity

The initial ideas for the product began from the observation that casual wine collectors were often forgetting the details of their wines. We investigated the various stages of wine enthusiasm through interviews and a survey, and found that current options for keeping track of a wine collection aren't quite ideal.

### Is there anything that frustrates you about collecting wine?

> "Forgetting the wines I love the best."
> "I can never remember the cost, where it came from or how long it will last."
> "The price! lol but I find its difficult to store and categorize."

### Please describe methods you currently use to organize and manage your collection. Do any of these methods incorporate technology?

> "None, but I could see that being useful."
> "I don’t use any. Masking tape and permanent marker to mark the ones my wife can’t open"
> "Nothing organized."

## Outcome

Winebox allows people to more easily understand and manage their wine collection, no matter how serious of a collector they are. Winebox accommodates Sunday sippers and seasoned sommeliers, and tells you everything you would like to know about your wines before you have to ask.
